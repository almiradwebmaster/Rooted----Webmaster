                <h4>油条配豆浆</h4>
                <h2>Chinese Crullers and Soy Milk</h2>
                <h3>Although typically served as a traditional Chinese breakfast, 
                Rooted’s Chinese crullers and soy milk has become one of our 
                most beloved dishes, available for anytime throughout the day. 
                Our cruller dough and soy milk are prepared with locally sourced 
                eggs, flour, and soybeans. The dough is rested overnight, 
                masterfully kneaded by our chefs, and fried in vegetable oil, 
                to create the perfect, airy, and light crullers. The fresh 
                soybeans are ground up, filtered, and boiled to produce our 
                authentic house made soy milk. Finally, pillowy soft Chinese 
                crullers are served with a bowl of warm, savory soy milk on the 
                side, mirroring cultural Chinese flavors and evoking a comforting 
                sense of nostalgia for all.</h3>

                <h4>蛋花汤</h4>
                <h2>Egg Drop Soup</h2>
                <h3>Our vegetarian take on this signature Chinese favorite is widely 
                    loved, and includes housemade vegetable broth, a substitute for 
                    the typical chicken broth, and locally sourced eggs that are fresh 
                    year round. The vegetable broth is first brought to a gentle boil, 
                    while beaten egg is slowly drizzled into the pot and stirred gently 
                    to form the delicate egg ribbons. In the end, a hot, comforting bowl 
                    of egg drop soup is served, maintaining the rich, authentic flavor 
                    that has deservedly become a world renowned dish.</h3>

                <h2>Bamboo Stir Fry</h2>
                <h3>Bamboo is one of the most widely known trademarks of Chinese culture, 
                    and it’s no surprise that we have integrated the traditional dish 
                    within our unique, vegetarian menu. That being said, our famous stir 
                    fried bamboo brings the flavors of China to you, as we partner with 
                    family-owned bamboo farms from the Tianmu Mountain region in Lin’an, 
                    Zhejiang, or the famous “Southern Bamboo Town”. Our dried bamboo shoots 
                    are imported directly from the source, cut into thinly sliced pieces, 
                    and boiled for hours to achieve the perfect tender, yet crunchy texture. 
                    Then, they are stir fried with other locally sourced vegetables, like 
                    bell peppers and scallions, to create a fragrant aroma and an earthy, 
                    nutty taste.</h3>

                <h2>Garlic String Beans</h2>
                <h3>Our string beans and garlic are sourced directly from local farms, 
                    so that our garlic string beans, one of Rooted’s most popular dishes, 
                    are made with the freshest, highest quality ingredients possible. 
                    Sliced garlic and string beans are masterfully pan fried with vegetable 
                    oil, and then stir fried with a touch of soy sauce and various house 
                    seasonings and aromatics, producing the bold, garlicky, and charred 
                    flavor we all know and love. </h3>
