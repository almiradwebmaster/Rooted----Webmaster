                <h2>Sourcing Ingridients</h2>
                <h3>Rooted is proud to identify as a farm-to-table restaurant. When crafting 
                    each dish, we always prioritize incorporating fresh, high quality ingredients 
                    in the food served, while simultaneously supporting local farmers and promoting 
                    agricultural sustainability. Farm-to-table means that instead of buying from 
                    large distributors, who may add preservatives and other harmful materials to 
                    their products, our food is directly sourced from nearby farms. As environmental 
                    and agricultural conservation become increasingly relevant within our ever-changing 
                    world, we are completely devoted to participating in eco-friendly practices, 
                    regarding our food sourcing and preparation procedures. That being said, you can have 
                    full confidence that our ingredients are 100% organic, natural, and cruelty free; from 
                    the Earth and full of flavor.</h3>
